# IP-Project
An individual project to build a **todo list application**. 

## Application
The application has text-based user interface with terminal input and output.

The application allows the user to create new tasks, assign them a title and due date, and choose a project for that task to belong to.


The user should be able to also edit, mark as done or remove tasks while they are using the application.


The user also should be able to quit and save the current task list to file, and then
restart the application with the former state restored.
